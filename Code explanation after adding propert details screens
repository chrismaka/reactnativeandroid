The tutorial challenge: Navigating from list entry for a house to a fresh screen with the full details for that house onclick.
First:
I implemented the the _onPressItem method in the SearchResults.js so that clicking any item opens up a new screen with a simple text on it.
 -_onPressItem = (index) => {
    let id = this.props.id;
    this.props.navigation.navigate('Details', {id: id})
  }
  
 Using the navigation prop(which is a prop ie something that helps you access attributes of views within that particular class, so that you can masnipulate or display the views).
 
 According to this https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/navigation-prop.html each screen/js representing a screen is automatically assigned a navigation prop that has fuctions that handle
 the different aspects of navigating from one screen to another. I would like to think of a navigation prop as a built in class with methods like navigate to handle moving from
 one screen to another.
 
Second:
I tried to solve the tutorial challenge on my own but failed to my limited knowledge on Flatlists, passing parameters to routes, fat arrow functions
,state, touchables, using listviews and so much more.

However, reading through the following resources helped make sense of the code and has given me a slightly better understanding of using react-native.
